Restaurant Table Booking System

You need to implement a simple restaurant table booking system.
The application should have a web based user interface, which the user can be request the number of table, the start date (and time), how long does he/she need the tables and how many people he/she wanted to book the tables and which restaurant does he/she wanted to book.
For every request the application should give back a response, which it informs the user about the success.


Example of the application request and response (Sketch):
Request:
- Restaurant: Rozsdás Rákolló
- Table Number: 3
- People Number: 12
- Date Time: 2017.06.15 18:15
- Long: 2 hour
Response:
- Succesfully booking your request

- Restaurant:
	id, name, city_id
- Table:
	id, number_of_seats, restaurant_id
- City:
	id, name
- Books:
	id, date_time, long (store in min), number of people
- Books-Table:
